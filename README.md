# Blackjack Game

A comprehensive command-line Blackjack implementation in Python, featuring proper game mechanics, player persistence, and extensive test coverage. This project is designed as both a playable game and an educational resource for intermediate Python programming.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains three main branches:

### ðŸŽ¯ **master** - Complete Implementation
- Full working Blackjack game with all features implemented
- Comprehensive documentation and type hints
- Production-ready code following Python best practices

### ðŸ“š **starter_code** - Educational Branch
- Method stubs and class skeletons for the Rochester Makerspace intermediate programming class
- Detailed docstrings explaining expected functionality
- Perfect starting point for students learning Python OOP

### ðŸ§ª **tests** - Testing Branch  
- Complete test suite with 200+ test cases
- Method stubs for implementation practice
- Focuses on test-driven development approach

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Standard Blackjack Rules**: Hit, Stand, and Double Down moves
- **Intelligent Ace Handling**: Aces automatically valued at 11 or 1 to prevent busting when possible
- **Dealer AI**: Follows standard casino rules (hits on 16, stands on 17)
- **Proper Scoring**: Handles blackjack (21 with 2 cards), busts, pushes, and standard wins/losses
- **Card Management**: Face-up/face-down card mechanics with proper reveals

### Player Management
- **Persistent Player Data**: JSON-based save/load system for player statistics
- **Bankroll Management**: Track winnings, losses, and enforce betting limits
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of wins, losses, pushes, and bankroll changes
- **Input Validation**: Robust handling of invalid user input with helpful error messages

### Technical Excellence
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean separation of concerns with proper abstractions
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Edge cases, error scenarios, and integration tests
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotation throughout the codebase
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions (`OutOfMoneyException`) and graceful failure recovery
- **Dependency Injection**: Testable design with mockable components

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd blackjack-game

# Choose your branch based on your needs:
# For complete game:
git checkout master

# For learning/teaching:
git checkout starter_code

# For test-driven development:
git checkout tests

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the game (master branch only)
python -m Blackjack.main_menu
```

## How to Play

### Starting the Game
Run the main menu and choose from three options:
1. **Play a new game** - Select an existing player and start a hand
2. **Create a new player** - Set up a new player with starting bankroll  
3. **Check player stats** - View win/loss records and current bankroll

### Gameplay Flow
1. **Ante Up**: Place your bet (must be between 1 and your current bankroll)
2. **Initial Deal**: You and dealer each receive two cards (dealer's first card face down)
3. **Player Decisions**:
   - **Hit**: Take another card (can repeat until stand, bust, or 21)
   - **Stand**: Keep current hand and end your turn
   - **Double Down**: Double your bet and receive exactly one more card (if you have sufficient funds)
4. **Dealer Turn**: Dealer reveals hidden card and hits until reaching 17 or higher
5. **Resolution**: Compare hands and update bankroll and statistics

### Winning Conditions
- **Player Blackjack** (21 with 2 cards) beats dealer 21 with 3+ cards
- **Dealer Bust** (over 21) - Player wins if not busted
- **Higher Total** wins (without busting)
- **Tie** results in a push (no money changes hands)
- **Player Bust** always loses, regardless of dealer hand

## Code Architecture

### Core Classes
- **`Card`**: Represents individual playing cards with suit, value, and face up/down state
- **`Hand`**: Manages collections of cards with intelligent ace valuation
- **`Player`**: Handles user input, betting, and statistics persistence  
- **`Dealer`**: Implements house rules and automated play
- **`Game`**: Orchestrates game flow, evaluation, and turn management

### Key Design Patterns
- **Abstract Base Class**: `GameParticipant` defines common interface for Player and Dealer
- **Dependency Injection**: Classes accept optional dependencies for testing
- **Factory Methods**: `Player.from_name_bankroll()` for convenient object creation
- **Strategy Pattern**: Polymorphic `take_turn()` methods for different participant types

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest Tests/Unit_Tests/test_player.py

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=Blackjack
```

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual class and method testing
- **Integration Tests**: Full game flow scenarios
- **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Parameterized Tests**: Comprehensive input validation testing
- **Mock Testing**: Isolated testing with dependency injection

### Test Coverage
- **200+ test cases** covering normal and edge case scenarios
- **File I/O testing** with temporary directories and error simulation
- **Input validation** with comprehensive invalid input testing
- **Game logic verification** including complex ace handling scenarios

## Educational Use

### For Students (starter_code branch)
- Implement methods following detailed docstring specifications
- Learn object-oriented programming principles
- Practice file I/O, exception handling, and user input validation
- Understand game logic implementation and state management

### For Instructors
- Complete test suite provides immediate feedback on implementation
- Progressive difficulty from simple classes to complex game logic
- Real-world application demonstrating multiple programming concepts
- Extensible design allows for additional features (splitting, insurance, etc.)
